# Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - Yet Another Party Organiser (YAPO)

[Nexus Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/539)

### Another party organisation mod to add to your ever expanding collection!

**IMPORTANT** If you used a version prior to 1.2.0, UIExtenderLibModule is a deprecated mod. Make sure you remove this mod from your load order. The library is included with this mod.

**IMPORTANT** If you used a version prior to 1.2.0, `Save Missing Module Fix` should no longer be needed for save files, as the vanilla saving mechanism has been removed in favour of a non-save-breaking JSON file alternative.
However, if you do have issues with a save file not loading after unloading this mod, please try using [ALTERNATIVE Save Missing Module Fix](https://github.com/bmountney/Aragas.AltSaveSystemFix/releases/tag/1.3.0.0). This version has been tested with this mod and works well.
We recommend loading this mod and your latest save, then saving the game again to remove the old data that this mod previously stored in the save file.
It is also advised to load this mod regardless of whether you have issues with saves or not.

## Features

### Sorting

- Separate Main Party and Other Party sorting
- Sorting modes:
  - Alphabetical (Name)
  - Type (Infantry, Ranged, Cavalry etc)
  - Group (Formation group)
  - Tier
  - Culture
  - Count
- Two sorting modes can be selected through two drop downs
  - Sorting is treated as Sort By -> Then By
  - Button to set opposite sorting direction between the Sort By -> Then By Modes, to allow more granular sorting rules
- Button to place upgradable troops at the top of the list
- Buttons will disable themselves if functionality is not available (e.g. cannot set opposite sorting if no Then By mode is selected)
- Sorting configuration is saved to your save file

### Party Actions

- Upgrade all single-path and most multi-path upgradable troops based on the culture's strength
- Recruit recruitable prisoners - sort order is respected, party limit is respected but can be overridden by holding CTRL
- Buttons will disable themselves if functionality is not available (e.g. no troops to upgrade)

### Hotkeys

- LCTRL + LSHIFT + A - Sort Ascending (Both Sides)
- LCTRL + LSHIFT + D - Sort Descending (Both Sides)
- LCTRL + {Move troops arrow} - Moves entire stack of troops
- U - Upgrade Troops

- Handling of all multi-path upgradable troops by ratio or by party composition
- Configurable main party prisoner and other party troops/prisoner (after battle) recruitment rules

## Versions

We maintain separate versions for Bannerlord Stable and Beta branches. The beta-compatible branch is clearly labelled with BETA in the files section.

We will aim to do the majority of development on the beta-compatible version, so new features will most likely hit that version before they hit stable.

For bugs and crashes, we will aim to make fixes for these available on both versions, depending on their nature.

Please make sure you identify which version you are using when reporting any issues on the github repository.

## Known Issues

- None
